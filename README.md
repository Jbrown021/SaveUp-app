INSPIRATIONS
 I tend to overspend on things sometimes excpecially when I dont check my bank as offten as I should.
 So I thought of making a tracker to gage my spending habits and calculate my money out checking if I can afford to splurg or not. Ihat way I can avoid spending too much, plan for what I want to buy and reduce the feeling of buyers remorse all before acutally going out to spend the money I may not have.

 UNFINISHED FUNCTIONALITY 

 The app itsself fully works and does all that it was made to do however the final snag I hit was coming to the deployment. Just could never get it to deploy sucessfully. tried many solutions but none of them worked then ran into a deployment limit using heroku.
